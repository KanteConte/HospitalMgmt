# KMRB_Hospital_Management_System

This is a Hospital Management System Project.
A hospital database management system keeps track of all doctors and patients associated with the facility and is controlled by the admin. The patient, doctor, and admin logins are available on the dashboard. Patients can register before they log in and can edit their info in the future. Patients can also use the platform to schedule an appointment with a doctor of their choice, and doctors can write prescriptions for them. Patients can also provide comments, which will be collected by the administrative staff. Admin has access to all available doctors and their appointments, as well as the power to add and delete doctors. Admin can view the feedback given by the patients as well as by doctors. Doctors can view their profile and their respective appointments with the Patients.
